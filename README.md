# School-System
A school management system made with HTML/CSS and PHP. Database using MySQL.
This is a web application built using HTML, CSS and PHP. I created the database with MySQL using the Apache HTTP Server. I group most of the connections with the database in the server.php file. The system was built using security implementation that allows teachers to add and delete courses and students to register to a new course.

Here is a simple Structure Diagram representing the functionality of the application:
